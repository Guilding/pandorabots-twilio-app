# Pandorabots on Twilio

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

You'll need to sign up for a plan on Chatbots.io to get an application ID and
user key. Once you've done this, you'll need to create a bot via the API (more
on this [here]())

You also need a Twilio account and an SMS enabled phone number.

Once you've entered all the proper credentials in the configuration screen,
return to the phone numbers tab in your Twilio dashboard. Click on the
"Messaging" tab and select "Configure with TwiML App". Create a new TwiML app
and use the URL generated by Heroku as the "Request URL" under messaging.
